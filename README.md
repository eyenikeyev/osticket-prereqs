1.) The first thing you are going to want to do is create a virtual machine by going to https://portal.azure.com/. Setup your virtual machine with Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2. Note, you will want to create a virtual machine with atleast 2 vcpus and 16 gbs of memory.

2.) Once you have created your virtual machine you will want to connect to it by using the public ip address the vm is setup with. You will connect using the remote desktop connection app.

3.) Once you have connected to your virtual machine you will want to go to your control panel. From the control panel open up programs. Select, Turn Windows features on and off.

4.) You will want to install / enable IIS in Windows with CGI and Common HTTP Features

5.) Now that the IIS is enabled, From the Installation Files, download and install PHP Manager for IIS (PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi) Go through the install wizard and complete the install.

6.) Next from the Installation Files, download and install the Rewrite Module (rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi)

7.) Create a folder in the C drive called PHP.

8.) From the Installation Files, download PHP 7.3.8 (php-7.3.88-nts-Win32-VC15-x866.zip) and unzip the contents into C:\PHP

<p>
Make sure that all common HTTP features are checked. To make sure the IIS is installed / enabled go to a browser of your choice and search for 127.0.0.1. If it dispalys IIS then it was done correctly.
